Student Pairing Script

This script creates pairings of students taking into account the past saved pairings.
The list of students is saved in a file with extension .cohort. The format of the file is one student per line.

During execution it will allow the creation of new, unsaved pairings by hitting the Enter key.
Once a desirable pairing is created, that pairing can be saved into the history.

The past pairings are saved in a file with extension .pastpairings. The format is a line per
student with the format student1::student3,student2,student8 which indicates student1 has been paired with student3, student2 and student8 in the past.
